      ReScrap is an online marketplace designed specifically for trading recycled and recyclable plastic materials. Sellers place their recyclable resources on the platform, and buyers can get in contact with sellers. It offers a truly unique global platform for recyclers, manufacturers, mills, re-grinders and brokers wherever they are worldwide. With the age of digitalisation the world has not only become a smaller place but itâ€™s no longer a localised marketplace, with worldwide trading you can always expect the best buyers and sellers to unite for the single purpose of trading.
